HR Attrition Prediction Project: Report Summary


Project Objective

To analyze HR data, identify the main drivers of employee attrition, and predict which employees are most at risk of leaving the company.

Approach
Loaded and cleaned the HR dataset (1,470 employees, 45 features after processing).

Encoded all categorical variables for machine learning compatibility.

Split data into train/test sets and scaled features for optimal modeling.

Builted a Logistic Regression classifier to predict attrition status.

Model Results =>
Accuracy: 86.05% on the test set.

Recall (leaving employees): 0.34 â€” model identifies some employees likely to leave, but as is normal with imbalanced data, not all.

Majority of predictions are correct for employees who stay (class 0).

Key Insights (Feature Importance)
The top drivers of employee attrition (leaving), according to model coefficients:

Feature	Impact on Attrition
OverTime	                           Increases attrition risk
BusinessTravel_Travel_Frequently	   Increases attrition risk
JobRole_Laboratory Technician	           Increases attrition risk
TotalWorkingYears	                   Reduces attrition (more years = safer)
YearsSinceLastPromotion	                   Increases attrition risk
NumCompaniesWorked	                   Increases attrition risk
EnvironmentSatisfaction	                   Reduces attrition (greater satisfaction = safer)
JobRole_Sales Representative	           Increases attrition risk
BusinessTravel_Travel_Rarely	           Increases attrition risk (less so)
JobSatisfaction	                           Reduces attrition

Interpretation: Employees who work overtime, travel frequently, have not been promoted recently, or report low satisfaction are at much higher risk of leaving.

Recommendations
Monitor and proactively engage employees with high overtime, low satisfaction, or many years since last promotion.

Support roles and departments identified with greater risk (Lab Techs, Sales Reps).

Consider reward/recognition or balanced travel/promotion opportunities.
